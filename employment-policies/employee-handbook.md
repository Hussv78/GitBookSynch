## PART I - Work Environment

### 1. EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER

Vi is committed to providing equal employment opportunities to all qualified persons. Vi does not discriminate against applicants or employees based on any protected grounds under the Ontario Human Rights Code, \(the “Code”\) including race, colour, ancestry, religious beliefs, ethnic origin, place of origin, citizenship, creed, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, mental or physical disability, ancestry, marital status, family status and/or any other prohibited grounds or factors protected by applicable provincial or federal laws.

As an Equal Opportunity Employer, vi views a diverse workplace as an asset. We commit to providing our employees with an inclusive workplace in which no person is denied employment opportunities for reasons unrelated to ability.

### 2. NON-DISCRIMINATION

Just as vi commits to provide equal employment opportunities for all prospective and current employees, vi expects its employees to play their part in ensuring a workplace free of discrimination or harassment.

Accordingly, the Company will not tolerate, ignore nor condone any form of discrimination. Any employees who engage in discrimination will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Any customers or visitors who engage in discriminatory action will be asked to leave Company premises. The Company will take any necessary steps to ensure a discrimination-free workplace, including barring the discriminating party from its facilities, where appropriate, or discontinuing business with contractors, consultants or service providers.

The goal of the Company’s Non-Discrimination Policy is to comply with the Company’s legislative obligations and to create a climate of understanding and mutual respect, where each employee feels as a valued part of the Company and is able to contribute fully to the development and well-being of the Company.

All employees are responsible for respecting the dignity and rights of their co-workers and the customers they serve, and to abide by this policy at all times. Employees are required to report all violations of this policy to their supervisors or managers immediately.

Management will investigate and deal with all concerns, complaints, or incidents of workplace discrimination in a fair and timely manner while respecting privacy concerns as much as possible. All complaints of discrimination will be handled by the Company in accordance with its Complaints and Investigations Procedures.

### 3. ACCOMMODATION

Vi will reasonably accommodate the known disabilities of employees who are otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of their jobs unless doing so would create an undue hardship. Vi also employs an inclusive hiring process, and will provide reasonable accommodations for prospective employees, when advised of their specific needs and/or limitations.

If you are unable to perform an essential function of your job because of a disability, you are encouraged to discuss possible accommodations with the Company. The Company will work with you to develop an accommodation plan, or a return to work plan if applicable. However, in order to understand any limitations you may have or accommodations you may need, vi may require supporting information from your medical practitioner\(s\). Such information may be necessary to ensure you and your fellow employees are safe while at work. You are required to play your part in the accommodation process, which includes cooperating with any reasonable requests for supporting medical documents.

The Company also makes reasonable accommodations for religious observances and for other factors or situations as required by the Code.

### 4. POSITIVE WORKING ENVIRONMENT

Vi is committed to maintaining a positive work environment for all its employees. We value your opinions and encourage you to bring your questions, suggestions, and concerns to the Company’s attention. We will give careful consideration to each of these in our continuing effort to create a positive work environment and build a strong relationship with our employees.

As in any workplace, however, issues may arise from time to time that may need attention. Differences of opinion may occur when people work together as certain situations are bound to be viewed differently.

In ordinary circumstances, you are encouraged to try to resolve your workplace issues directly with your fellow employee\(s\). In the event you are unable to resolve your issue in an amical fashion, seek assistance from your immediate supervisor. If you are still unable to resolve your issue, or unsatisfied with the solutions offered by your supervisor, you are welcome to file a complaint in accordance with the Company’s Internal Complaint and Investigation Procedure.

### 5. RECRUITMENT

When making decisions regarding employment, vi will comply with all relevant statutory obligations.

The Company's main goal when filling new or vacant positions is to ensure that the person best suited for a position is selected for that position. As such, vi will look to both internal and external candidates when filing new or vacant positions.

### 6. PROBATIONARY PERIOD

All new employees, whether paid by salary or on an hourly basis, will undergo a probationary period of 3 months upon joining the company. The purpose of the probationary period is to permit vi to evaluate employee competency in the position and give new employees the opportunity to evaluate the Company.

Near the end of the probationary period, the new employee’s job performance will be reviewed by vi. If employees are retained after the probationary period, length of service will be calculated from their original date of hire.

New employees under probation whose performance or other employment conditions are determined to be unsatisfactory may be terminated without formal advance notice. Similarly, probationary employees have the right to resign at any time within the first 3 months without providing formal notice.

### 7. TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES

At vi, we believe that training and development for our employees is critical to our success as a Company. By continuing to develop and polish our skills, we are able to successfully meet the growing needs of our clients.

Throughout your employment, vi will provide you with training opportunities to help you obtain the tools you need to grow in your career. We believe that having the best trained, knowledgeable employees will strengthen our business. We want you to be challenged and excited about your career at vi. We encourage you to learn, grow, and contribute to our future success.

### 8. HOURS OF WORK AND ATTENDANCE

Employees are expected to keep regular working hours, and maintain their scheduled shifts, as set by the Company. Our clients depend on you and your co-workers depend on you to be accountable. An unscheduled or unexpected absence results in an interruption of services for our clients, and additional stress and workloads for other employees. Accordingly, you are expected to be at work, and ready and able to work at the start of your shift.

Occasionally, you may be faced with unexpected situations which prevent you from reporting to work on time. In order to facilitate coverage in your absence, you are required to notify your supervisor as soon as possible.

If you know that you will be late for work, you should notify your supervisor by the end of your preceding shift, so arrangements can be made to cover your position for a short period of time. If circumstances prevent you from knowing you will be late, you must notify your supervisor as soon as possible prior to your scheduled start time. All absences from work must be reported personally by you, unless you are medically unable to do so.

Excessive tardiness or culpable and unexcused absences may subject you to corrective action up to and including termination for cause.

If you fail to report for work and you fail to call in for three consecutive days, and provide a reasonable explanation for your unexcused absence this will be considered as job abandonment, and the Company shall consider your continued absence from work as a de facto resignation.

### 9. OVERTIME & TIME OFF IN LIEU

From time to time, you may be required to work beyond your regularly scheduled shifts in order to satisfy the needs of our client.

In the event you work more than 44 hours per work week, and you are eligible to receive overtime pay, you will receive overtime pay for all hours worked in excess of 44 hours in the week. In order to be eligible to receive overtime pay, overtime hours worked, must receive prior approval from the Company.

Vi may permit employees to receive paid time off in lieu of receiving overtime pay, at its discretion. Employees accumulate lieu time in a lieu time account. Employees may schedule time off using accumulated lieu time by submitting a request with the Company. The Company will make every effort to grant these requests, but scheduling of lieu time is subject to operational requirements. Scheduling requests must be made in accordance with vi’s Vacation Policy.

If any unused lieu time remains in the employee’s lieu time account when employment ends, it will be paid out to the employee on his/her final pay statement.

### 10. EMPLOYEE CLASSIFICATIONS

Your employee classification depends on the nature of your job and the number of hours per week you are regularly scheduled to work. Your eligibility to receive certain benefits and the application of some Company policies may vary according to your classification as part-time, full-time, causal, temporary, or contractor.

Full-time employees are regularly scheduled to work at least 30 hours per week and may be eligible to receive Company benefits. Employees who are regularly scheduled to work fewer than 30 hours per week are considered part-time employees. Part-time employees may not be eligible for some benefits. Temporary and casual employees, and contractors are not eligible for any benefits.

Please review vi’s benefit plan booklets for more information about the specific benefits you are eligible to receive.

### 11. MEAL PERIODS

Employees are entitled to take 30 to 60 minutes for meal breaks each day, depending on their job. Meal breaks are scheduled in accordance with business needs and are unpaid time off from work. Employees are required to take their meal breaks each day.

Meal periods are not counted toward determining overtime eligibility.

### 12. PAY PERIODS

Vi pays its employees on a bi-weekly basis. All pay is subject to required statutory deductions and withholdings. Our regular work-week begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday.

Employees who are paid by the hour are required to log their time worked accurately and in accordance with Company standards and procedures. Falsifying your timesheet is fraud \(time theft\) and may result in corrective action up to and including dismissal.

Although the Company makes every effort to accurately process payroll, errors occasionally occur. If, at any time, you believe that an error has been made such that your pay cheque does not accurately reflect the appropriate compensation for the hours worked or that incorrect or inappropriate deductions were taken, you should immediately report the error to the Controller. All payroll issues will be promptly investigated. If it is determined that an error was made, it will be corrected, including reimbursement for any incorrect or improper deductions.

### 13. EMPLOYEE EXPENSES

Employees who incur reasonable business-related expenses, including travel expenses, shall be reimbursed for those expenses by the Company in accordance with regular practices, provided they receive prior authorization from the Company before incurring any such expenses.

Employees must keep copies of all receipts and provide them to the Company in order to be reimbursed.

Employees are required to use good judgment when incurring expenses on behalf of vi. Unreasonable, or unnecessary expenses will not be reimbursed by the Company, at its sole discretion.

### 14. EMPLOYEE CONTACT INFORMATION

Employees are responsible for providing the Company with up to date contact information and are required to advise vi of any changes to their personal information. Vi relies on this information to administer your employment relationship, including ensuring your payroll is processed properly, and sending you notices and important documents from time to time. The Company also requires up to date contact information to contact your designated emergency contact person\(s\) in case of an emergency. Accordingly, it is your responsibility to ensure all required information is accurate and up to date, at all times.

### 15. EMPLOYEE FILES

Vi stores your personal information, and additional workplace records in your confidential employee file. The Company respects the privacy of its employees, so your employee file is only accessible to designated personnel for company business purposes, including to process payroll, or contact your family or designated emergency contact person\(s\). Your employee file will never be shared with another third party, without your prior consent, unless otherwise required by law. Any employee who improperly accesses an employee file without authorization, will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination for cause.

Your employee file may contain some or all of the following information:

* job application;
* job description;
* resume;
* records of participation in training events;
* salary history;
* records of disciplinary action; and
* documents related to employee performance reviews, coaching and mentoring.

All employee files are the property of vi and access to the information is restricted. With reasonable advance notice, employees may review their own employee file in the presence of their supervisor or the Controller.

### 16. BULLETIN BOARDS

Bulletin boards or notice boards may be located at vi’s premises to provide employees with information concerning business-related matters, or events. Bulletin boards are not to be used for personal notices or as all-purpose boards. In the event you have a document or other information that you would like to post in the office, please ensure you receive prior approval from the Company before posting.

## PART II - Conditions of Employment

### 1. BACKGROUND CHECKS

Vi conducts background checks on all prospective job candidates as part of its inquiry into their suitability for employment in accordance with its Background Checks Policy. Background checks help vi ensure its employees have the skills and qualifications to perform their roles in a competent manner. They also help vi mitigate potential legal and operational risks. The Company recognizes the importance of maintaining a safe and productive workplace with honest, trustworthy, qualified, reliable, and employees who do not present a risk of harm to their co-workers or others.

Employees are expected to cooperate fully with vi’s Background Checks Policy. Such cooperation includes, among other things, providing truthful and complete information in response to inquiries made by the Company or third-party screeners.

For more information about vi’s background check procedures, consult the Company’s comprehensive Background Checks Policy.

### 2. CODE OF CONDUCT

Vi has established a comprehensive Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Policy, to promote high standards of integrity and honesty. All employees are required review this policy, and abide by it at all times. Any violations shall be subject to discipline, up to and including termination for cause.

### 3. COMPLIANCE

Vi has established a Corporate Compliance Program to ensure vi and all its employees are aware of the Competition Act, their responsibilities to abide by it, and the consequences for failing to do so. It’s critical that all employees participate in all required training, and understand their obligations under the law. Violations of the law and vi’s Corporate Compliance Program will be subject to discipline under vi’s progressive disciplinary policy. However, more importantly, violations of the law may also result in both administrative penalties for vi and employees, and criminal imprisonment.

In additional to compliance with the Competition Act, vi is committed to operating its business in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. In the employment context this means, vi, is committed to ensuring compliance with the Code, the Occupational Health and Safety Act,1990 \(the “H&SA”\), the Employment Standards Act, 2000, \(the “ESA”\) and all applicable regulations and additional statutes that regulate employment matters.

Employees are likewise required to do their parts and follow all requisite laws and regulations that affect their duties and responsibilities. Employees must also ensure compliance with the policies set out in this Handbook, and all other relevant policies, procedures, plans and programs.

### 4. LEGAL DISCLOSURE AND INVESTIGATIONS

Vi will cooperate with any legal investigations conducted by relevant authorities or regulators, including investigations of employees. Although vi does not disclose your personal information to third parties without your prior consent, vi may disclose any information about you, including personal information, if required by law.

### 5. CLIENT RELATIONS

The Company provides services to its clients with a great deal of pride. Our clients rely on us for regular support, and we have distinguished ourselves in the marketplace, based in large part on our client support capabilities. The strength of our business depends on our clients, and what our clients think of vi, largely depends on how you treat them.

All employees are expected to give the best possible service to all clients. All clients, large and small, should receive the same courteous treatment with no exceptions or favouritism.

When in contact with clients \(whether on the phone or by email\) you are expected to conduct yourself in a courteous and professional manner at all times. This includes making sure that you do not discuss any matters that a client could consider offensive or distasteful including but not limited to comments that are discriminatory, offensive, obscene, insulting or vulgar. As a general practice, when making small talk, avoid discussing religion, politics or other topics that individuals may have strong opinions about, in order to avoid potential inadvertent personal offences.

When meeting with clients, employees are required to dress professionally, and to exercise sound judgment when entertaining clients.

### 6. GRATUITIES OR GIFTS FROM CLIENTS

As a general practice, employees are prohibited from soliciting any personal gifts or gratuities from clients in accordance with vi’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Policy.

Employees are also prohibited from accepting tips or gratuities, even if provided without solicitation, in order to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, or the perception of favouritism among other employees.

In the event a client is insistent on offering you a tip or gratuity, you are to politely advise the client that it is against Company policy for you to accept the tip or gratuity, and advise the Company immediately. Failure to do so, could be subject to discipline, up to and including termination for cause.

Although vi has a strict, no tips/gratuities policy, employees may accept occasional unsolicited courtesy gifts or favours of a nominal value \(e.g., business lunches or holiday baskets\), as long the favours or gifts are customary, and do not appear to influence the judgment or conduct of the employee in the Company’s business.

If you are uncertain about whether you may accept an unsolicited gift or favour of nominal value from a client, please first consult with the Company before accepting it.

### 7. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \(IT\) AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS

Access to computers, networks, communications systems and other IT serve as the backbone of vi’s business operations, and critical to our day to day operations. Access to these systems is also provided to employees to promote effective communication and working practices within our organization.

Accordingly, the Company has implemented a comprehensive Information Technology \(IT\) Communications Systems Policy \(the “IT Policy”\) to provide clear standards of use, information about the steps vi takes to protect its assets, and additional information which is critical to the effective functioning of the Company’s IT and communications systems.

The IT Policy applies to all employees, and to any contractors, volunteers, or agents who have access to vi’s IT and communication systems. It provides significant detail about the following topics, and associated rules, guidelines and procedures:

* Equipment security and passwords, including anti-malware, mobile devices and removable media;
* System and data security;
* Remote access;
* Telephone and voicemail use;
* Email, test messaging and instant messaging;
* Internet use;
* Personal use of IT and communications systems;
* Monitoring;
* Prohibited uses; and
* Consequences for failure to comply with the policy.

As a general guideline, Employees should have no expectation of privacy in any content created, transmitted, received, accessed or stored on the Company’s IT and communications systems. Vi monitors its IT and communications systems regularly, with a variety of electronic and physical tools further outlined in the IT Policy.

Employees are required to review the IT Policy very carefully, and abide by it at all times. Any violation of vi’s IT Policy, will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination for cause.

### 8. RECORDING DEVICES

Employees are prohibited from the surreptitious use of audio or video recording equipment without the prior authorization of the Company, including but not limited to, cameras or audio or video recording functions available on cell phones or other handheld mobile devices.

In the event an employee requires the use of any audio or video recording equipment for business purposes, the employee must first seek authorization from the Company before using such equipment.

### 9. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

Vi keeps certain types of information confidential for important business reasons, such as providing the Company with a competitive edge over competitors and protecting the Company’s trade secrets and intellectual property rights. In other cases, third parties, including clients entrust the Company with their confidential business information and rely on us to protect that information. An information security breach could severely damage the Company’s business relationship\(s\) with the clients, and can also cause harm to our clients. Accordingly, vi strives to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its confidential information, and that of its clients and suppliers, while complying with applicable privacy and data protection laws, including but not limited to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, 2000 \(“PIPEDA”\).

All workforce members, including employees, contractors, volunteers, agents and other third parties, accessing or using our confidential business information must take due diligence to protect the Company’s confidential information. It is part of everyone’s job.

The Company has also established comprehensive information security policies which provide additional safeguards for securing confidential information. Employees are required to review these, and abide by them at all times. Accordingly, all workforce members are required to comply with this policy and with further rules and procedures set out in vi’s comprehensive Information and Data Security Policy, its IT and Communications Systems Policy, its Cyber Incident Response Plan and in all other relevant policies, procedures, guidelines, plans and rules.

Confidential information is generally defined as any “information that may cause harm to the to the Company, its customers/clients, employees, or other entities or individuals if improperly disclosed, or that is not otherwise publicly available.” For a more detailed definition of Confidential Information, please consult vi’s Information and Data Security Policy.

Unless information is marked otherwise or clearly intended to be public information, treat all vi and client information as if it is Confidential Information, regardless of its source or form, including electronic, paper, verbal, or other information. Any employee who is unsure whether information is confidential should always check with vi before disclosing the information or taking any other action.

Employees who have access to Confidential Information may be required to sign a Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement as a condition of employment. In the event there is any inconsistency between this policy and an employee’s individual confidentiality agreement, the terms of the confidentiality agreement shall govern.

Vi may also require third parties, including contractors, to sign a confidentiality agreement before receiving any of the Company’s Confidential Information. Employees must help ensure the protection of the Company’s Confidential Information by abiding by this requirement when communicating or sharing information with a third party with whom the Company is doing business.

The Company may agree to comply with specific client information security policies or standards where it receives confidential business information from the client. In such cases, all affected employees must comply with any such policies or standards, including any related training or additional background screening requirements.

Employees must treat all Confidential Information as strictly confidential both during employment and after their employment with the Company ends. To maintain the confidentiality of the Company’s Confidential Information, all employees must follow the following procedures:

**Access**  
No employee shall access or use any Confidential Information unless prior authorization has been granted by the Company. Employees may only use Confidential Information as required for the performance of their own job duties, or as otherwise required by the Company.

Employees may not remove Confidential Information from the Company’s IT and communications systems or its premises, unless specifically authorized by the Company.

If an employee’s job duties require sharing Confidential Information with a third party, the employee must not do so until vi and the third party enter into a confidentiality agreement, unless the employee is provided with written authorization from vi.

**Discussions**  
Only discuss Confidential Information in non-public places, or if a discussion in a public place is absolutely necessary, take reasonable steps to avoid being overheard. Do not discuss Confidential Information in public, including elevators, restaurants, cabs, and public transportation.

### 10. INSIDER INFORMATION

During the course of their duties, employees may obtain confidential information from clients, about pending non-public products/inventions, reorganizations, achievements, failures or other information which could constitute “insider information”. Vi employees must take steps to secure this information and avoid direct or indirect disclosure to any other party, including other vi employees who have no reasonable business purpose to know the information. Employees are prohibited from using such information for their own personal benefit \(financial or otherwise\) or for the benefit \(whether directly or indirectly\) of any other person or party.

Violations of this policy are subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment for cause. Employees who use insider information in violation of the law, may also be subject to criminal prosecution.

### 11. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Vi takes the protection of its intellectual property very seriously, and has developed this policy, its Confidential Information policy found above, and its Data Security Policy, its IT and Communications Systems Policy, and additional workplace policies and procedures to safeguard its intellectual property.

“Intellectual Property” means all Confidential Information, copyright works, trade-marks, industrial designs, design rights, inventions \(whether patentable or not\), unpublished patent applications, inventive ideas, discoveries, innovations, developments, or improvements thereto, or any other intellectual property rights relating to any of the foregoing, whether registered or non-registered, whether or not reduced to written form or practice, within the scope of vi’s business activities.

During their employment with vi, employees may participate in, or individually invent, intellectual property, inventions, processes, procedures on behalf of vi. All such intellectual property is owned exclusively by vi. Certain employees may be required to sign an Intellectual Property Agreement as a condition of employment. In the event there is any inconsistency between this policy and an employee’s individual confidentiality agreement, the terms of the confidentiality agreement shall govern.

All rights, title and interest in any Intellectual Property, and any improvements thereto, that an employee conceives, develops, invents, authors, creates or contributes to the creation or improvement of, in whole or in part, during the term of their employment are, will be and shall remain the exclusive property of vi.

Employees shall have no interest in any Intellectual Property, including without limitation, no interest in copyright, inventions, patents, patent applications, industrial design, industrial design applications, trade- marks, trade secrets, Confidential Information and any other form of intellectual property, notwithstanding that an employee may have conceived, developed, authored, created or contributed to the creation or improvement of the same, solely or jointly with others or during or after the employee’s working hours or with or without the use of vi’s property, equipment or supplies or at vi’s premises or elsewhere, at any time during the term of the employee’s employment.

All employees must do the following:

* Immediately disclose to vi in writing all Intellectual Property that the employee conceives, develops, invents, authors, creates or contributes to the creation or improvement of, in whole or in part, during the term of the employee’s employment.
* Assign to vi any right, title or interest the employee has or may have in the future in such Intellectual Property, that the employee conceives, develops, invents, authors, creates or contributes to the creation or improvement of, in whole or in part, including any inventions, patents, patent applications, copyright works, industrial designs or any other form of intellectual property.
* Irrevocably and unconditionally waive and not assert any and all moral rights that the employee may now have or may have in the future to any such Intellectual Property, including but not limited to, the right to the integrity of any copyright works, the right to be associated with any copyright work as its author by name or under a pseudonym, and the right to remain anonymous.
* Execute any instruments or documents and perform all acts deemed necessary by the vi, both

  during and after the employee's employment ends, to permit and assist the vi, at the vi's

  expense, to draft, prepare, obtain, maintain, defend and enforce any patents, copyrights,

  industrial designs and other intellectual property rights resulting from such Intellectual Property.

* Give all necessary assistance to vi to enable it to enforce its Intellectual Property rights against

  third parties, to defend claims for infringement of third party intellectual property rights and to

  apply for registration of vi's Intellectual Property rights, for the full term of those rights.

For clarity, this policy does not apply in respect of any invention or copyright for which no equipment, supplies, facility, Intellectual Property or Confidential Information of the vi was used, which was developed entirely on the Employee's own time, and which does not:

* relate to the business of vi;
* relate to the employee's actual or demonstrably anticipated processes, research or

  development; or

* results from any work performed by the employee for vi.

Any breach of this policy will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination for cause. Employees who misappropriate vi’s Intellectual Property, may also be subject to legal proceedings initiated by vi, and/or criminal prosecutions initiated by relevant authorities.

### 12. SOCIAL MEDIA

Vi recognizes that the internet provides unique opportunities to participate in interactive discussions and share information on particular topics using a wide variety of social media, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, Tumblr, blogs, micro-blogging sites, YouTube, content communities, chat rooms, bulletin boards and wikis. Social media use by the Company’s employees, may form part of their job duties and, is a normal activity in their personal lives.

This policy applies to the use of social media platforms by Company employees during working time and during non-working time.

An employee’s use of social media can pose risks to the Company, its employees, and its clients. Some of these risks include:

* Damage to the Company’s IT and communications systems.
* Harassing, threatening or discriminatory online behaviour directed toward co-workers or clients.
* Unauthorized disclosure of the Company’s confidential and proprietary information.
* Damage to the Company’s reputation and brand.
* Unauthorized collection, use or disclosure of client confidential or proprietary information.
* Unauthorized collection, use or disclosure of employee or client personal information.

To minimize these business and legal risks, to avoid loss of productivity and distraction from employees’ job performance and to ensure that the company’s IT and communications systems are used appropriately as explained below, the Company expects its employees to adhere to the following guidelines and rules regarding social media use, both during working hours and on employee personal time.

Employees must never use social media in a way that violates the Company’s other workplace policies or any agreements with the Company, including but not limited to the vi’s Information and Data Security Policy, or its IT and Communications Systems Policy. If social media activity would violate any such policies or agreements in another forum, it will also violate them in an online forum.

Vi recognizes that employees occasionally may desire to use social media for personal activities while at work or through the Company’s computers, networks and other IT and communications systems. Vi permits such use, in accordance with its IT and Communications Systems Policy during non-working time so long as it does not involve vulgar, obscene, threatening, intimidating or harassing content, does not violate any other vi policies or employee obligations and does not interfere with the employee’s employment responsibilities or productivity. However, any use of vi’s systems to access social media will be subject to monitoring, to ensure the security of those systems and compliance. Accordingly, employees have no expectation to privacy when they access the Company’s devices and networks to use social media for personal activities.

#### a\) Business Use of Social Media

Any employee required to use social media as part of the employee’s job duties \(including for vi’s marketing, public relations, recruitment, corporate communications or other business purposes\), must abide by the following requirements:

Vi owns all social media accounts used on behalf of vi or otherwise for business purposes, including any and all log-in information, passwords and content associated with each account, such as followers and contacts. Vi owns all such information and content regardless of the employee that opens the account or uses it, and will retain all such information and content regardless of separation of any employee from employment with vi.

Any employee whose job duties include speaking on behalf of vi in a social media environment must seek approval in advance for such communication from the CEO, who may require the employee to receive training before doing so and impose certain requirements and restrictions with regard to social media activities.

Likewise, if an employee is contacted for comment about vi for publication, including in any social media outlet, the inquiry must be directed to the CEO, in accordance with vi’s Media Relations policy. The employee must not respond without prior written approval.

#### b\) Guidelines for Employees’ Responsible Use of Social Media

In using social media, employees must remember that their actions online may affect their workplace. Employee actions or statements through social media, even those made through personal accounts during non-working time, that harm the interests of vi, its employees or its clients, or that otherwise breach vi’s policies, may result in discipline, up to and including termination of employment for just cause in accordance with vi’s Progressive Discipline Policy.

In using social media for any reason, work-related or personal, employees should abide by the following common-sense guidelines.

* **Assume anything posted online is public**. Social media is usually public, and there is no guarantee that anything shared online will remain private, regardless of a social media account’s privacy settings. Employees are personally responsible for what they communicate through social media and should act accordingly.
* **Speak on your own behalf**. Employees must be clear in their social media activity that they speak on their own behalf. They must use a personal email address and contact information in personal social media activities.
* **Use a disclaimer**. Employees who disclose their affiliation as employees of vi should include a disclaimer that their views do not represent those of vi. For example, consider such language as “the views in this posting reflect my personal views and do not represent the views of my employer.”
* **Be mindful of vi’s interests**. Employees have a duty of loyalty to their employers. Employees should not make disparaging comments about vi or its employees or clients on social media, or engage in conduct that is harmful to vi’s interests or reputation, or that is competitive with vi’s business.
* **Use good judgment**. Employees should remember that anything said online can reflect on vi, even if a disclaimer is used. Employees should strive to be accurate in their communications about vi and remember that online statements have the potential to result in liability for the employee or vi. Vi encourages professionalism, respectful conduct and honesty in social media and other communications.
* **Be respectful**. Employees are required by vi’s policies to avoid harassing, threatening or discriminatory conduct on social medial that impacts on co-workers or other workplace parties. In

  personal use of social media, employees should also avoid conduct that vi’s clients, would find offensive, including ethnic slurs, sexist comments, discriminatory comments, profanity, abusive language or obscenity, or comments that are maliciously false.

* **Report inappropriate postings**. If an employee is aware of any social media content that disparages or reflects poorly on vi, or constitutes harassment or threatening behaviour towards an individual in the workplace, the employee should contact the Compliance Officer.

Any violation of this policy may be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment for cause, in accordance with vi’s Progressive Discipline Policy.

### 13. MEDIA RELATIONS

While we strive for openness and honesty, we must protect the privacy of our employees, our clients as well as the confidentiality of our business relationships and strategies. Accordingly, employees are prohibited from making any unauthorized comments to the media, including on electronic media such as on blogs, about any company business. Any inappropriate public comments could negatively impact the company or undermine our market advantage or breach a confidentiality agreement with a client or other party.

Any inquiries from the media about vi, it’s clients, its business or any other matters should be immediately directed to the CEO. The CEO will determine in his sole discretion whether a comment will be made, and by whom.

### 14. EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT

Vi maintains certain rules of behavior, which must be observed to ensure a safe and workplace. For the welfare of all of us, certain actions are unacceptable. Vi does not condone or tolerate employee misconduct or bad behaviour, and offending employees shall be subject to discipline in accordance with the Company’s Progressive Discipline Policy:

The following list is not intended to be all inclusive. It simply illustrates some of the types of misconduct that are unacceptable at the Company, and subject to discipline:

* Violating the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Policy, or exposing the Company to any legal or regulatory risk.
* Violating the terms of this Employee Handbook, or any additional Company policies, procedures, plans, guideline or rules.
* Violations of any of vi’s security or safety procedures.
* Falsifying or misrepresenting facts onany Company document.
* Repeated culpable attendance issues \(i.e., tardiness, leaving early, unexcused absenteeism, not being available during working time\).
* Insubordination or the refusal or failure to perform work properly or to follow instructions.
* Sleeping or the appearance of sleeping during work hours.
* Engaging in unethical or disorderly conduct.
* Unauthorized use of Company equipment or resources.
* Possession of or removal of Company or client property from Company premises/or from Company or client devises, without prior authorization.
* Defacing or damaging Company, client, or another person’s property.
* Bringing firearms or other weapons on Company premises or property.
* Use, possession, sale, or transfer of drugs or alcohol on Company premises, or reporting to

  work or performing Company business under the influence of d r u g s o r alcohol.

* Gambling while on Company premises.
* Fighting, violence, using abusive language, or threatening another employee, client or other

  third parties.

* Engaging in any discriminatory or offensive activities, which negatively impact employees,

  clients or other third parties.

* Smoking in prohibited areas.

The Company reserves the right to impose corrective action up to and including dismissal where the Company deems it appropriate and necessary to do so, at its sole discretion.

### 15. PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE

Vi expects its employees to abide by their obligations in the workplace and exercise self-discipline at all times. Occasionally, it may be necessary to administer disciplinary action in instances of employee misconduct or for poor performance.

The purpose of this Progressive Discipline Policy is to correct the inappropriate behaviour or misconduct and to motivate employees to improve in the future.

When imposing discipline, vi will generally follow the procedures set out in this policy, and escalate discipline for repeated offences of the same nature. However, vi reserves the right to examine the specific facts and circumstances surrounding a transgression and skip steps in this policy where appropriate, in its sole discretion. The level of severity and frequency of the infraction will also be taken into account in determining the appropriate level of discipline.

Vi may apply the following forms of discipline, or substitute alternate forms, at its discretion:

1. Informal Counselling;
2. Verbal warning;
3. Written Reprimand & Corrective Action Plan; and
4. Termination for cause.

**Informal Counselling**  
The employee is counselled by his/her manager in an effort to eliminate misunderstandings and to explain what constitutes acceptable conduct and behaviour.

**Verbal Warning**  
When informal counselling has not produced the desired results or the situation has become worse with respect to the same concern or another unrelated but cumulative incident has occurred, the employee is given a verbal warning which will be recorded in his/her Employee file.

**Written Reprimand & Corrective Action Plan**  
The purpose of a written reprimand is to make certain that the employee is fully aware of the misconduct he/she has committed and what corrective action is required to improve his/her behaviour. A written reprimand or corrective action document may include timelines for improvement, and will typically follow instances where verbal warnings have not been effective in correcting the misconduct.

An employee may receive a final written warning, following serious misconduct or repeated instances of misconduct where there has not been sustained improvement. The purpose of a final written warning is to make certain that the employee understands the serious nature of the misconduct and that he/she is aware that further misconduct will result in their immediate termination of their employment for cause.

**Termination**  
An employee will be terminated for cause as a result of a serious offence or as the final step in the progressive disciplinary process, following the culmination of less serious offences or poor performance that have not been improved following a corrective action plan.

The following are some forms on misconduct may be subject for immediate termination on the occurrence of a first office \(this list is not inclusive\):

* Corruption/ Bribery;
* Misappropriation of Company or client confidential or proprietary information for personal \(or

  third party\) gain;

* Breach of employment agreement;
* Harassment or voluntary discrimination;
* Workplace violence;
* Embezzlement or fraud;

### 16. INTERNAL COMPLAINT AND INVESTIGATION PROCEDURE

Vi has developed an internal complaint and investigation procedure to ensure that all employees are able to raise any concerns they have relating to vi, its business practices, employees, clients, physical and cyber security, workplace issues \(including harassment, violence and discrimination\), codes of conduct, policies and procedures, or other matters, in a safe and secure manner. Vi takes all employee concerns and complaints seriously and each formal complaint made in accordance with this procedure will be investigated promptly.

As general practice, vi will first attempt to handle complaints internally, and all complaints will be treated with the strictest confidence possible, given the circumstances. In some certain instances, vi, may decide to retain an independent third party to conduct the investigation.

#### a\) Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to provide employees with a safe forum to raise their workplace concerns. This procedure has also been implemented to ensure all complaints are investigated and resolved in an efficient manner.

#### b\) Responsibility

The compliance officer is responsible for developing, implementing and administering vi’s internal complaint and investigation procedure. Accordingly, all formal complaints must be submitted to the compliance officer in accordance with the following procedures.

#### c\) Confidentiality

Vi and the compliance officer shall treat all complaints with the strictest of confidence. However, in order to thoroughly investigate complaints, certain information will need to be shared with other parties, including other employees and the individuals against whom complaints may be made. The discretion whether or not to share certain information shall rest with vi and the compliance officer. However, all employees who participate in the investigation, whether as complainant, respondent or witness, shall all be required to keep the circumstances of the investigation as confidential as possible to protect the affected parties and to limit any disruptions in the office.

#### d\) Procedures

The following investigation procedures may vary depending on the nature of any complaint. The company reserves the right to deviate from this process on a case-by-case basis.

#### Step 1

If an employee has a concern with another employee, the employee should first attempt to resolve the issue with the other employee, at the earliest opportunity possible. Any complaints that are unrelated to another employee, for instance, a regulatory or business practice issue, or a complaint about a customer or another third party, are to proceed directly to step 2 for resolution.

#### Step 2

If the employee is not able to resolve the issue with the other employee, he or she should discuss the matter with the compliance officer. This discussion will remain confidential in the event the employee decides not to pursue the matter further, unless the compliance office is required to disclose the nature of the discussion by law, in which case the employee will be advised of the circumstances relating to the disclosure.

#### Step 3

Unless otherwise instructed by the compliance officer, the employee will submit a formal complaint in writing to the compliance officer, in a written format that a complainant is comfortable providing, with as much detail concerning the complaint as is practicable, along with supporting documents, if applicable.

#### Step 4

The compliance officer \(and in many cases another senior manager\) will commence a prompt and thorough investigation into the complaint by reviewing the facts and all other factors pertinent to the issue\(s\), which will include, but will not be limited to; holding interviews with affected parties and other individuals with information relevant to the complaint. The nature of the investigation will depend on the nature of the complaint and the specific facts at hand.

#### Step 5

After the investigation is complete, the compliance officer \(and the other investigator, if applicable\) will give consideration to the merits and evidence of the complaint and make a recommendation concerning resolution.

#### Step 6

The compliance officer will communicate the outcome of the investigation to the complainant and any affected parties. Where appropriate, discipline will be imposed on any employee that is found to have engaged in misconduct, or has otherwise violated any workplace policies, procedures or codes of conduct.

#### e\) Instances of discrimination, violence or harassment

In certain cases, given the nature of the complaint, an employee may not feel comfortable first discussing the matter with the individual against whom the complaint is made. In such cases, employees are permitted to by-pass “step 1” and proceed directly to “step 2” of the procedure.

Employees who feel uncomfortable discussing the circumstances of the complaint on their own at step 2, are permitted to bring another employee, or support person \(for instance a family member\) to the meeting for support, provided that before the circumstances of the complaint are discussed, the employee communicates to the compliance officer the nature of the other person’s presence at the meeting.

If an employee does not feel comfortable discussing certain issues with members of the opposite sex, the employee should advise the compliance officer, and he/she will appoint another senior employee or an independent third party to conduct the investigation.

#### f\) Regulatory, health and safety, and criminal matters

In certain situations, vi may choose to, or may have a duty to disclose the circumstances of a complaint or the results of an investigation to a regulatory body or public authorities. In such cases, vi shall comply with all legal obligations, notwithstanding any employee’s objection to the disclosure.

In cases where a complaint is made about workplace harassment, or vi becomes aware of an incident of workplace harassment, vi shall conduct an investigation in the incident, notwithstanding any objections to the investigation from any affected party, in accordance with its obligations under Bill 132, Sexual Violence and Harassment Action Plan Act.

#### g\) Information & data security complaints or inquiries

Vi’s information and data security policy contains specific procedures related to suspected data or information security incidents. Any complaints or inquiries related to data or information security should be directed to the technical operations manager, in accordance with vi’s information and data security policy.

#### h\) Non-retaliation

Vi does not tolerate any retaliation or reprisals against employees for raising any complaints with vi, the compliance officer or another member of management. If an employee has filed a complaint in good faith, the employee will not be disciplined or otherwise penalized because of the complaint, regardless of whether or not the complaint is ultimately sustained following the investigation.

## PART III Security & Safety
